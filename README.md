butterYeeter's Simple 16 Bit Crappy CPU(BS16BCC)

This is a repo containing the logisim evo .circ files for my crappy cpu project :D

I have plans to make this turing complete and eventually build this on bread boards. I also plan on writing a basic assembler in C for this CPU.

Goals:
- **ISA TO COMPLETE**
    
- Write a complete assembler in C complete with ints, chars and bools.Should also have\
  flow control like for loops and if statements.
  
- Write pong in assembler language
  
- Implement the logical circuitry on breadboards to mess around with.
  
- Future upgrades:
    - Add RAM storage
    - 32 Bit / Floats
    - 2's Complement representation of numbers
    - Floating Point Unit
    - Implement stack, call stack and multiple program loading in RAM.
  
  
- Current tasks:
    - Hardware addition, multiplication, division and subtraction for unsigned ints. #COMPLETE
    - Add RAM for temp storage. #COMPLETE
    - Configure instuction decoder. #COMPLETE
    - Review ISA and improve it. #COMPLETE
    
    - Write an assembler for the cpu in C#INPROGRESS
    
    - Screen output? #TODO
    
    
    - Complete 8 bit prototype with simple instructions. #DISCARDED
